% remember to compare Sf and Sh^2 when deciding whether bending or wear is a threat to the gear
% for crowned gears, use Sf and Sh^3


%% Bending Calculations 
% Preliminary
dp = Np/Pd;         % pitch diameter
V = pi*d*n/12;
Wt = 33000*H/V;     % transmitted load

% Bending General Equations
bendStress = Wt*Ko*Kv*Ks*(Pd/F)*(Km*Kb/J)   % bending stress
bendFatigue = (St*Yn)/(Sf*Kt*Kr)           % bending fatigue/endurance strength
bendFS = ((St*Yn)/(Kt*Kr))/bendStress       % bending factor of safety


%% Wear Calculations 
% Preliminary
dp = Np/Pd;
V = pi*d*n/12;
Wt = 33000*H/V;

% Wear General Equations
wearStress = Cp*(Wt*Ko*Kv*Ks*Km*Cf/(dp*F*I)   % wear/contact stress
wearFatigue = (Sc*Zn*Ch)/(Sh*Kt*Kr)           % wear fatigue/endurance strength
bendFS = ((Sc*Zn*Ch)/(Kt*Kr))/wearStress       % bending factor of safety
