# asu_mee342project
Mechanical Design Project

- Created Code for Gear Design [MATLAB]
- Please see files for code breakdown; all code is annotated to explain the process and variables used/defined
- **For further explaination of different input variables, please refer to Chapter 14 of Shigley's Design Textbook. definitions, equations, tables, and factors can be found there.**

There are two code files provided in this repository:

  **final_code**; provides a detailed code that was created through a combination of those found in other repositories, ChatGPT and our own edits. The general code was in many ways based off Shigley's Design Textbook, and the many examples it provides in Chapter 4. This code requires many necessary assumptions in order to run. More detail below:
  
_This code serves as the final copy._

  **prelim_code**; we recommend this code for simple uses. Provides a more bare bones, but easily interpreted version of a Spur Gear analysis. However, this code is translated from the textbook analysis equations. Much of it can be added upon proceeding with the project, and the necessary assumptions are determined.
  
_This code serves as the foundational iteration._
