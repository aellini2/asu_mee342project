# Turbine Gear/Pinion Design Code for mee342_asu

- Created Code for Gear Design [MATLAB]
- Please see files for code breakdown; all code is annotated to explain the process and variables used/defined
- **For further explaination of different input variables, please refer to Chapter 14 of Shigley's Design Textbook. definitions, equations, tables, and factors can be found there.**

There are two code files provided in this repository:

  **gear_code**; provides a detailed code that was created through a combination of those found in other repositories, ChatGPT and our own edits. The gear code was primarily based off Shigley's Design Textbook, and the many examples it provides in Chapter 14. This code requires many necessary assumptions in order to run. More detail can be found by viewing it

  **prelim_code**; we recommend this code for simple uses. Provides a more bare bones, but easily interpreted version of a Spur Gear analysis. This code is translated from the textbook analysis equations in Shigley Ch 14. Much of it will be expanded upon when proceeding with the project, and the necessary assumptions are determined. Please note many assumptions are made for this code to be viable.
